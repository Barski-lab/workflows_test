Bismark report for: /var/lib/cwl/stg1aeaf550-2da5-46f1-909c-9b9f5a537400/upstream.fastq (version: v0.22.1)
Option '--non_directional' specified: alignments to all strands were being performed (OT, OB, CTOT, CTOB)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /var/lib/cwl/stgad98a211-d470-467c-ac17-c16c8d0ecb53/data/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.2 --ignore-quals

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequences analysed in total:	125
Number of alignments with a unique best hit from the different alignments:	87
Mapping efficiency:	69.6%
Sequences with no alignments under any condition:	38
Sequences did not map uniquely:	0
Sequences which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	0

Number of sequences with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/CT:	2	((converted) top strand)
CT/GA:	1	((converted) bottom strand)
GA/CT:	42	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/GA:	42	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)
